# The Task is to use the California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. 

♦ This data includes metrics such as population, median income, and median housing price for each 'block' group in California. The model will predict the median housing price in   any district, given the other metrics.

♦ The dataset contains 20640 entries and 10 variables.

 
 
 
The columns/variables are as follows:
 
★ Longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west

★ Latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north

★  HousingMedianAge: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building

★  TotalRooms: Total number of rooms in a block

★  TotalBedrooms:Total number of bedrooms within a block

★ Population: Total number of people residing within a block

★  Households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block

★ MedianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)

★  MedianHouseValue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)

★  OceanProximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea
